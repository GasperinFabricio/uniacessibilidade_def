# Uniacessibilidade

Uniacessibilidade is a prototype website designed to promote the concept that locations should be rated based on their level of accessibility. Our mission is to raise awareness and provide valuable information to individuals with disabilities, helping them find places that are accessible and meet their needs.

## Key Features

  - Accessibility Ratings: Users can view and contribute to the accessibility scores of various places, such as restaurants, parks, stores, and public buildings.
  - User Reviews: Community-driven reviews and feedback help improve the accuracy and reliability of accessibility information.
  - Location Search: Easily search for places based on their accessibility scores and find detailed information about the facilities they offer.
  - Interactive Map: Visualize accessible locations on an interactive map for a better user experience.

The idea is being shown with Leaflet, in a near future it would be optimal to integrate it with Google Maps.
